# Capstone-Project READ ME

App title: good-fi
```
Description: student project, full stack using JS, PSQL, CSS, HTML
```

Theoretically, good-fi is the beginnings of a platform for sustainable finance share/stock trading/investment.
```

In practice, it is a basic, experimental student 'Capstone Project' completed during the Software Engineering Program at the Institute of Data (Australia) in 2022.
```

Capstone project requirements were as follows:
```

Client-server architecture
```
A database for CRUD operations
```
Displaying data and updating it
```
A user interface to submit new data Unit testing
```

Code-base is javascript. More specifically, this is an Express Node JS web application. This framework helps manage servers and routes.

I have used Supertest and Jest for the testing the API. Jest is a javascript test runner for running automated tests, and supertest provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP.
